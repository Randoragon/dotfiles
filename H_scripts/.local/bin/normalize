# This script is a simple wrapper for running mp3gain recursively
# on a library full of mp3 music files.
# Last run gets stored in a log file as a sanity check.
#
# mp3gain acts on the replaygain values stored in id3v2 tags,
# so before you run this command be sure those are up to date.
# Here's a list of steps for normalizing music, in order:
# 
# 1. Run `beet replaygain -f ...` (run by default during import)
# 2. Run `beet write ...` to save replaygain in the physical files
# 3. Run `normalize` to adjust music and after that recalculate replaygain tags
# 4. Run `beet update ...` to update the recalculated replaygain tags

musicdir=~/Music
log=~/.cache/normalize-latest.log

# Filter out the lines that state no changes
find "$musicdir" -type f -name '*.mp3' -print0 | xargs -0 mp3gain -s i -r -e -c \
    | sed -n '/^\(No changes to \|\/\)/!{H;g;p} ; h' >"$log"

# View the log if any changes were made
[ -n "$(cat "$log")" ] && "$PAGER" "$log"
