    gpg-sec - execute a gpg command with temporary secret primary key

SYNOPSIS
    gpg-sec [OPTIONS] PARTITION GPG_ARGS...

DESCRIPTION
    gpg-sec will probe the selected device for a file called \"%s\". If
    found, it will import it into the local gpg keyring. It will then
    run gpg with the remaining arguments. When the execution finishes,
    the imported key will be permanently deleted from the keyring.

    The intended use is temporarily importing primary secret keys to
    perform routine tasks such as changing key expiration dates etc.

    Under any normal circumstance running this command as superuser is
    not advised, as you will most likely fail to import the secret key.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
    print this help message and exit

EXAMPLE
    gpg-sec /dev/sdc1 --edit-key user@email.com

" "$fname"
    exit
}

[ $# -lt 2 ] && echo "gpg-sec: at least 2 arguments required" >&2 && exit

# Validate device path
[ -e "$1" ] && lsblk -lno NAME | grep -qF "${1#/dev/}" || {
    echo "gpg-sec: device $1 not found" >&2 && exit 1
}

# Mount the device in a temporary, safe location
mountdir="$(mktemp -d -p /tmp gpg-sec.XXXXX)"
mountdev="$1" ; shift
chmod 0700 "$mountdir" || { echo "gpg-sec: failed to set directory permissions" >&2 && exit 2; }
sudo mount -r "$mountdev" "$mountdir" || { echo "gpg-sec: failed to mount $mountdev" >&2 && exit 3; }
[ ! -f "$mountdir/$fname" ] && { echo "gpg-sec: secret key not found on device" >&2 && umount "$mountdir" && exit 3; }
[ ! -r "$mountdir/$fname" ] && { echo "gpg-sec: secret key found but no read permissions" >&2 && umount "$mountdir" && exit 3; }

# Import secret primary key from device
gpg --import "$mountdir/$fname" || { echo "gpg-sec: failed to import secret key" >&2 && umount "$mountdir" && exit 4; }
sudo umount "$mountdir" || { echo "gpg-sec: failed to unmount $mountdev" && exit 5; }

# Run the user command

# Delete the primary secret key from keyring
