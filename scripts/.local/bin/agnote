# Search all notes for a substring. For more details
# on notes read comments inside the note script.
#
# GNU pass actually has a grepping function, but
# I haven't found a way to make it only search in
# the notes directory. Also, the silver searcher
# produces prettier output and is a lot faster.
#
# This script doesn't use any long-term cache,
# which causes it to be heavy and slow. Use it only
# when you actually need to perform a serious search.
#
# Dependencies:
# - ag (the_silver_searcher)
# - pass
