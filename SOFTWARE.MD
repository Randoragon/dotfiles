# Software Packages

## Description

This file holds the current Linux programs that I use and their purpose in my workflow.
It is not a complete list of all the software that I use, just a reminder of what programs
I find worthy and don't want to forget about in case I need some very specific tool.

AUR packages are prefixed with \*.
